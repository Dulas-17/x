<h1>What are astronomical seasons?</h1>
<p>Astronomical seasons are the four seasons namely:<mark>Summer</mark>,<mark>Autum</mark>,<mark>Winter</mark> and <mark>Spring</mark> that are defined by the Earth's position in its obirt around the sun.</p>
<div class="pos_cen">
<h2>Astronomical Summer</h2>
<img class="img_deg" src="images/summer.jpg"alt="summer image"width="200px"height="100px">
<p><i>Astronomical Summer is one of the four seasons,characterized by the warmest temperatures of the year.It is a time when days are longest,and nights are shortest;making it the brightest season.Northern hemisphere summer begins around june 21st/22nd lasting until around september 22nd/23rd and in the southern hemisphere it begins around december 21st/22nd and ends around murch 21st/22nd.</i></p></div>
<div class="me">
<h2> Astronomical Autum</h2>
<img class="nuh" src="images/autum.jpg"alt="autum image"width="200px"height="100px">
<p><i>Astronomical Autum,also known as fall in some regions.This season is characterized by the vibrant transformation of foliage,with leaves changing colors to shades of red,orange,yellow and brown before eventually falling to the ground.In the northern hemisphere autum begins around september 22nd/23rd lasting until around december 21st/22nd and in the southern hemisphere begins march 20th/22nd and ends around june 20th/21st.</i></p></div>
<div class="hey">
<h2>Astronomical Winter</h2>
<img class="winter" src="images/winter.jpg"alt="winter image"width="200px"height="100px">
<p><i>Astronomical Winter is the coldest season of the year,characterized by shorter days and long nights.In the northern hemisphere ,winter begins around december 21st/22nd and ending around march 20th/21st and in the southern hemisphere it begins around june 20th/21st and ends around september 22nd/23rd.despite the coldness winter brings its own beauty and sense of peacefulness,as nature rests and prepares for renewal  of spring.</i></p></div>
<div class="wow">
<h2>Astronomical Spring</h2>
<img class="spring" src="images/spring.jpg"alt="spring image"width="200px"height="100px">
<p><i>Astronomical Spring is a season of renewal,growth,and transformation;as the world awakens from dormancy of winter.In the northern hemisphere spring typically begins around march 20th/21st and ends around june 20th/21st and in the southern hemisphere spring typically begins around september 22nd/23rd and ends around december 21st/22nd.During spring  trees and plants begin to bud and bloom,covering the landscape in vibrant colors.</i></p></div>
<h2>why do seasons start at different times in the northern and southern hemisphere?</h2>
<p>Seasons start at different times in the northern and southern hemisphere due to the earth's tilt and obirt around the sun.</p>
<h3>Earth's tilt</h3>
<p>The earth is tilded on its axis at an angle<br>of about 23.5 degrees.This means that,as it<br> orbits the sun,different parts of the planet recieve<br> varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. </p>
<h3>Earth's Orbit around the sun</h3>
<p>The earth takes about approximately 365.25days<br> to complete one obirt  around the sun,This means that,as it moves through its obirt,<br>different hemispheres are tilted towards or away<br> from the sun.</p>
